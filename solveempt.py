    This is the function you will implement. It will take in a numpy array of the board
    as well as a list of n tiles in the form of numpy arrays. The solution returned
    is of the form [(p1, (row1, col1))...(pn,  (rown, coln))]
    where pi is a tile (may be rotated or flipped), and (rowi, coli) is 
    the coordinate of the upper left corner of pi in the board (lowest row and column index

    -You can assume there will always be a solution.
